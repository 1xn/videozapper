A quick hack in bash to show a random playlist of videos in a folder

Only tested in Linux as Mac and Windows VLC version doesnt have the console version (cvlc)

Not the most elegant solution just a proof of concept.

It reads a directory, creates an array and chooses one from the list.

Uses the command line VLC as a player (cvlc) and figlet to display the cool logo. :D

Key to quit - change videos is "-" 

Youll have to change the directory where your videos are located.

Looking for better ways to do this.
