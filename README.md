Did this a long time ago,. around 2011 as a proof of concept. 

Should work on Linux without issues if you have CVLC installed, no OSX or windows!

**It basically works like this:**
You have a folder full of movies and the script plays a random movie at a random position, with a defined key it loads up another random movie at a random position, giving you a TV Zapping experience. Tested with about 500 movies and its pretty fast! Feels like TV. 

I was thinking of implementing different keystrokes to load up different folders as channels (1) for Sci-Fi (2) Drama (3) Docus etc. 

Uses CVLC as a player, couldnt figure out another way to do this quick hack. Looking for ideas!
